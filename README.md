# ToDay Todo App

This is a school project, created in a Team. With their consent I placed the code on my Github page.   
The assignment was to develop a basic Android Application, for managing your Todo's.  
In 3 sessions we got teached the basics of Android development with Java. 

You can create, edit and delete Tasks and Labels. A Task can only have one Label, but a Label can contain multiple Tasks. You can see your open tasks and completed tasks, filter them by label. Please try it out with Android Studio!

## Running the app
### Device
This code was developed with a **Pixel 5, API 29** emulator. There are no return buttons, because this device has a return button on the device (like most Android devices)

### Demo account
There is a Demo account available:  
Username: **demo**  
Password: **test**  

No labels or tasks are present yet, you have to add them yourself. Besides using the demo account, it's also possible to create your own account.  
The password needs to contain a number, an uppercase letter and a lowercase letter. The password must contain between 8 and 20 characters.

## Improvements
Because of the little time there was for finishing this projects, there are still improvements possible. A few things I would have done differently:
* Usage of DRY and methods
* Usage of KISS
* Cleaning up unused imports and variables
* Making variables private if possibles
